# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

# Tech Stack for FileBridge  

FileBridge is built using modern and efficient technologies to provide a seamless and high-performance file-sharing experience. Below is an in-depth breakdown of the technologies we used and why they were chosen.  

## ðŸ“¦ Framework & Development Tools  

### [**Expo**](https://expo.dev/)

Expo is a powerful framework for building universal React Native applications. It simplifies the development process by offering a managed workflow, allowing for easier testing, deployment, and maintenance. With Expo, we can quickly iterate on features, leverage built-in APIs, and ensure smooth performance across different platforms without dealing with complex native configurations.  

## ðŸŽ¨ UI & Styling  

### [**Gluestack v2**](https://gluestack.io/)  

For styling and UI components, we chose **Gluestack v2**, a robust component library that allows for flexible theming and scalable UI development. It provides a utility-based styling approach, similar to Tailwind CSS, making it easy to build a responsive and customizable interface while keeping performance in check.  

### [**Lucide**](https://lucide.dev/)  

Lucide is a modern, open-source icon library that offers a clean and consistent design. It ensures that our app maintains a polished look with well-crafted icons that enhance usability and visual appeal.  

## ðŸš€ Performance & Optimization  

### [**Shopify - FlashList**](https://shopify.github.io/flash-list/)  

Since our app deals with file management, efficient rendering of file lists is crucial. We use **FlashList**, a high-performance list rendering library developed by Shopify, to ensure smooth scrolling and optimal memory usage, even when handling large numbers of files. Compared to React Nativeâ€™s default FlatList, FlashList offers superior performance and responsiveness.  

### [**React Reanimated**](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/)  

To create smooth and fluid animations, we utilize **React Reanimated**. This library allows us to build performant animations and gesture-driven interactions without impacting app performance. It works seamlessly with **React Gesture**, making UI transitions feel more natural and engaging.  

### [**React Gesture**](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/)  

React Gesture enables complex touch gestures, such as swipes and drags, to be handled efficiently. It enhances the user experience by providing intuitive touch interactions that feel responsive and natural.  

## ðŸ”¥ State Management & Data Fetching  

### [**Redux**](https://react-redux.js.org/)  

For managing global state efficiently, we rely on **Redux**. It helps keep our appâ€™s state predictable and scalable, ensuring that changes in one part of the app are seamlessly reflected everywhere they need to be.

### [**TanStack Query**](https://tanstack.com/)  

To handle data fetching, caching, and synchronization, we use **TanStack Query**. This powerful library ensures our API calls are optimized, reducing unnecessary re-fetching while keeping data up to date in real-time. It improves app performance and reduces load times, making file sharing and access more efficient.  

## ðŸŽ¬ Animations & User Engagement  

### [**Lottie**](https://github.com/lottie-react-native/lottie-react-native#usage)  

To make the app more engaging, we integrate **Lottie**, a library that enables the use of lightweight, vector-based animations. Lottie animations help improve the overall user experience by providing smooth visual feedback, such as loading indicators and success confirmations, without compromising performance.

### **Why This Tech Stack?**  

The combination of these technologies ensures that FileBridge is:  

- **Fast and responsive** â€“ With FlashList, React Reanimated, and optimized data fetching.  
- **Scalable and maintainable** â€“ Using Redux for state management and Expo for easy deployment.  
- **User-friendly and visually appealing** â€“ Thanks to Gluestack v2, Lucide icons, and Lottie animations.  
- **Efficient and seamless** â€“ Offering smooth file uploads, sharing, and QR code generation with minimal friction.  

With this tech stack, we aim to provide an intuitive and high-performance platform for effortless file sharing. ðŸš€
